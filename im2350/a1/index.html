        <h3>Week 2 research questions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h4>
                <div>There are some aspects of this experience that stood out immeadiately. First of all, the animations that
                    introduce you to the website draw attention to the page's content. Furthermore, the 'explore me' button
                    shakes which makes you more likely to interact with the button first. So in conclusion, the animations
                    are the first thing that I paid attention to.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
                <div>During my two-minute experience with the website, these were my discrete actions:</div>
                <ol>
                    <li>I see the animations introducing me to the website.</li>
                    <li>I notice the 'explore me' button shaking, I move my mouse to the location of the button and click it.</li>
                    <li>I see more animations showing buttons which I presume to be indicating different webpages, and I move
                        my mouse to the top button, 'Portfolio', click it, and another animation indeed leads me to a new page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Another animation draws my attention which displays text, suggesting to sort projects by clicking
                        categories, which are displayed below the text.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the 'CSS' category, click it, but I found that this disables the category rather than
                        enables it.
                    </li>
                    <li>I click the 'CSS' category button again to enable it, and move my mouse over all other buttons while
                        clicking them to disable the others.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the first option, 'Portfolio Website', and click it.</li>
                    <li>I read some text and see a project link. I move my mouse to the link, click it, and I'm in a new tab 
                        I'm lead to a GitHub page.
                    </li>
                    <li>I quickly look over the contents, move my mouse to the tab of the webpage, and click it to go back.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the top left button which is an arrow which I presume to lead me back to the home page,
                        and it does.
                    </li>
                    <li>I scroll down as the vertical bar suggests there is content to be found below. Nothing happens,
                        so I try again by scrolling up and down but it does not have an effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>I hover my mouse over the picture in the middle. It animates by flipping over and it shows his name.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the 'About & Skills' button at the top, click it, and I read through the list
                        with skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the top left arrow again to go back to the home page.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
                <div>I would say I spent the most time engaging with the experience on the 'Portfolio' page. While looking over
                    the different projects, the categorizing system worked the other way around than what I expected, so after
                    figuring it out I spent some more time looking through the projects from one specific category.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
                <div>The most common (and probably most obvious) action was moving my mouse to certain locations of buttons and
                    clicking them. Furthermore, I spent a lot of time observing the animations and text, and tried to
                    scroll several times.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
                <div>I would say the primary goal of the experience is to showcase his work as a student, developer, and 
                    contributor. He has also added a contact page so the goal could be to showcase his work in order to
                    be contacted by potential employees for example.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h4>
                <div>In the 'About @ Skills' page, he describes his skills in the areas of web development. So the 
                    portfolio is actually the ultimate showcase of these skills, and therefore I think this experience
                    communicates the primary goal very well.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h4>
                <div>I would argue that the experience should be interacted with following the shaking 'explore me' button.
                    Through this menu, you gradually go over the topics that are included in the menu to get to know all
                    about this person's portfolio. The most time would be spent in the 'Portfolio' page as this page
                    showcases his previous work and is the best way to look at his skills in practice, in different categories.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>
                <div>I think the shaking animation is meant to suggest clicking it first as this is the main attention drawer. 
                    As the 'Portfolio' page is also top of the menu, I would say that this page is also meant to be the 
                    most important page.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
