        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h4>
                <div>There are some aspects of this experience that stood out immeadiately. First of all, the animations that
                    introduce you to the website draw attention to the page's content. Furthermore, the 'explore me' button
                    shakes which makes you more likely to interact with the button first. So in conclusion, the animations
                    are the first thing that I paid attention to.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h4>
                <div>During my two-minute experience with the website, these were my discrete actions:</div>
                <ol>
                    <li>I see the animations introducing me to the website.</li>
                    <li>I notice the 'explore me' button shaking, I move my mouse to the location of the button and click it.</li>
                    <li>I see more animations showing buttons which I presume to be indicating different webpages, and I move
                        my mouse to the top button, 'Portfolio', click it, and another animation indeed leads me to a new page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Another animation draws my attention which displays text, suggesting to sort projects by clicking
                        categories, which are displayed below the text.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the 'CSS' category, click it, but I found that this disables the category rather than
                        enables it.
                    </li>
                    <li>I click the 'CSS' category button again to enable it, and move my mouse over all other buttons while
                        clicking them to disable the others.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the first option, 'Portfolio Website', and click it.</li>
                    <li>I read some text and see a project link. I move my mouse to the link, click it, and I'm in a new tab 
                        I'm lead to a GitHub page.
                    </li>
                    <li>I quickly look over the contents, move my mouse to the tab of the webpage, and click it to go back.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the top left button which is an arrow which I presume to lead me back to the home page,
                        and it does.
                    </li>
                    <li>I scroll down as the vertical bar suggests there is content to be found below. Nothing happens,
                        so I try again by scrolling up and down but it does not have an effect.
                    </li>
                    <li>I hover my mouse over the picture in the middle. It animates by flipping over and it shows his name.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the 'About & Skills' button at the top, click it, and I read through the list
                        with skills.
                    </li>
                    <li>I move my mouse to the top left arrow again to go back to the home page.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h4>
                <div>I would say I spent the most time engaging with the experience on the 'Portfolio' page. While looking over
                    the different projects, the categorizing system worked the other way around than what I expected, so after
                    figuring it out I spent some more time looking through the projects from one specific category.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h4>
                <div>The most common (and probably most obvious) action was moving my mouse to certain locations of buttons and
                    clicking them. Furthermore, I spent a lot of time observing the animations and text, and tried to
                    scroll several times.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h4>
                <div>I would say the primary goal of the experience is to showcase his work as a student, developer, and 
                    contributor. He has also added a contact page so the goal could be to showcase his work in order to
                    be contacted by potential employees for example.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h4>
                <div>In the 'About & Skills' page, he describes his skills in the areas of web development. So the 
                    portfolio is actually the ultimate showcase of these skills, and therefore I think this experience
                    communicates the primary goal very well.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h4>
                <div>I would argue that the experience should be interacted with following the shaking 'explore me' button.
                    Through this menu, you gradually go over the topics that are included in the menu to get to know all
                    about this person's portfolio. Over time, the most time would be spent in the 'Portfolio' page as this page
                    showcases his previous work and is the best way to look at his skills in practice, in different categories.
                    If someone was to return to this website repeatedly, this is the page that would be opened the most. This 
                    is also because this page contains the most variety of text which can be researched.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h4>
                <div>I think the shaking animation is meant to suggest clicking it first as this is the main attention drawer. 
                    As the 'Portfolio' page is also top of the menu, I would say that this page is also meant to be the 
                    most important page.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="w3">Week 3 questions</h3>

        <ol start="9">
            <li>
                <h4>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h4>
                <div>It is clear that this experience references to an individual's portfolio; a collection of his personal
                    achievements, experiences, skills, and characteristics.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h4>
                <div>Although there is no one format that represents a portfolio, there are certain aspects that suggest this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>There is a photo of the represented person.</li>
                        <li>Some key words and a quoted sentence briefly describe him as a person.</li>
                        <li>An 'Explore Me' button suggests the need to find out more about this person.</li>
                        <li>The menu items at the top suggest that there is information to be found about this person.</li>
                    </ul>
                    These factors all communicate that this experience should be engaged with in an exploratorive way:
                    to go through these menus in order to find out all about this person's skills, characteristics, and
                    experiences.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h4>
                <div>This reference suggest that you should feel curious about getting to know this person and his skillset.
                    I imagine this is specifically aimed at potential employers, to make them curious about what this person
                    can bring to their team. Furthermore, this curiosity is meant to be converted into excitement, about this
                    person, his skills, and achievements. In the context of the potential employer, this excitement could mean
                    being convinced of this person's abilities and therefore wanting to reach out for a job offer.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h4>
                <div>What I found most frustrating about the interaction was not being able to scroll down on the home page.
                    The vertical bar and three dots on it suggest that there is more content to be found, especially below,
                    but neither the three dots are interactable and scrolling down does not do anything. I think this is a 
                    missed opportunity to show your abilities in web programming and make a nice experience as a whole.
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h4>
                <div>The most satisfying part would have to be the animations that ease you in and out of every page and
                    menu options. This creates a nice smooth feeling where everything functions as one, and it's a 
                    satisfying view for the eye. It also gives a sense of having an overview of the entire website
                    even when you're going through the pages.
                </div>
            </li>
        </ol>
